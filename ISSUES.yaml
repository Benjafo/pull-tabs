UI:
  - Icons should bounce in-sync on the back of the card
  - UI spacing issue next to $100 for front of card
  - Weird transition to right side of screen when flipping card
  - Icons need rework
  - When dragging pull tabs, it briefly reverts to an unpulled state and kicks off the animation again
  - Add permissioning to only show box progress modal to authorized users
